Hi!

I am Giorgi _(Greek: Geá¹“rgios)_. Although I dislike writing about myself, I will share some trivia here that can help you understand about the type of person I am:

- I am studying Computer Science at KIU (Georgia). Despite roots of collectivism in academia, it's a good way to challenge and organize yourself.

- I am an **Emacs devotee**. My goal is to help close issues on GitHub for Doom Emacs. Along this path, I may become proficient in Lisp to make real-world contributions gradually. I hope Doom Emacs will reach v3.2.0 so I can relax and reflect a bit. ðŸ˜Ž

- I am fond of **functional programming**. I studied OCaml at university and continued with Clojure. It was through this journey that I discovered Emacs.

- I enjoy **reading** and always try to read a book or two about topics I am interested in. Currently, my focus is mostly on software and programming.

- I listen to blues and country music. Yes, I am **old-fashioned**.

- I am studying German and have a love/hate relationship with it. I hope to conquer its grammar challenges in the future.
